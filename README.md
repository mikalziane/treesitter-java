## Installation de treesitter

### NVM vs NPM
"NVM helps manage multiple Node.js versions on the same machine, enabling developers to switch between them as needed."
"NPM, on the other hand, is a package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install, share, and manage dependencies in their projects."

### Installer ces outils 
node.js <= nvm 

node-gyp <= npm

node-gyp <= python

Contrary to what is said in in one of the guides above, it does not seem that node-gyp currently needs python 2 any more.

Beware also that some commands do not run in powershell while they run in cmd. For instance 

"where py"  runs in cmd

while in *powershell* you need to run "where.exe py"
